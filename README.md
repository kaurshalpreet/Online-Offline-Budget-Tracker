## Description

Online/Offline Budget Tracker is an app where user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a data/internet connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online. So, a user will be able to track their withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection and check if their account balance is accurate when they are traveling.
<br>
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the applications success. <br>
